[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) implementation in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

* Written in pure rust
* Generates rust code
* Has runtime library support for generated code
  (Coded{Input|Output}Stream impl)
* Supports both Protobuf versions 2 and 3
* and more

## Where is documentation

Documentation is moved to the crates.

* [protobuf=2](https://docs.rs/protobuf/=2)
* [protobuf=3](https://docs.rs/protobuf/>=3.0.0-alpha)

(Note both versions 2 and 3 or rust-protobuf support both `proto2` and `proto3`
syntax of `.proto` files.)

## About versions and branches

### Version 2

`2.*.*` is the latest stable version. `2.*.*` versions follow semver conventions,
including generated code: code generated with `2.*.*` is compatible with newer `2.*.*`.

### Version 3

Compared to version 2, it has:
* runtime reflection support
* JSON and text format parsing and printing (based on reflection)
* dynamic messages (messages which can be created using schema but without generated code)

Version 3 of rust-protobuf is mostly feature-complete, but to release it:
* more testing needed
* API need to be polished since breaking API is not semver-friendly

Current plan is to release version 3 in a few weeks.

[Tracking issue for rust-protobuf=3](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/issues/518).

The crate **needs help**:
* testing
* documentation
* examples to be used as documentation
* feedback on API design
* feedback on implementation
* pull requests
* a new maintainer

## Changelog
